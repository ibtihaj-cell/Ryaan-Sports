                Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman
                Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman

                Test cricket is a game that spans over two innings. This means that one team needs to bowl the other
                team out
                twice and score more runs then them to win the match. Another key difference between test cricket and
                other
                forms of cricket is the length of the innings. In test cricket there is no limit to the innings length.
                Whereas
                in one day cricket & Twenty20 cricket there are a certain amount of overs per innings. The only limits
                in test
                cricket is a 5 day length. Before the game begins an official will toss a coin. The captain who guesses
                the
                correct side of the coin will then choose if they want to bat or field first. One team will then bat
                while the
                other will bowl & field. The aim of the batting team is to score runs while the aim of the fielding team
                is to
                bowl ten people out and close the batting teams’ innings. Although there are eleven people in each team
                only ten
                people need to be bowled out as you cannot have one person batting alone. Batting is done in pairs.

                Once the first team has been bowled out the second team would then go into bat. Once the second team is
                then
                bowled out it would normally return to the first team batting again. However there is an exception to
                this in
                the cricket rules, it is called the follow-on. The follow-on is when the first team makes at least 200
                runs more
                than the second team made (in a 5 day test match). This then gives the first team the option to make the
                second
                team bat again. This is particularly useful if the game is progressing slowly or affected by bad weather
                and
                there might not be enough time for both teams to play a full innings. Should this be the case the
                batting team’s
                captain also has the right to forfeit their innings at any time. This is called a declaration. Some may
                wonder
                why a captain would forfeit the opportunity for his team to bat. However if the game is coming close to
                a close
                and it looks like they will not be able to bowl the other team out again this could be an option. If one
                team is
                not bowled out twice and a winner determined in the five days of play the game is declared a draw.
                Therefore it
                may be worth declaring an innings to creat the possibility of a win rather than a draw.

                <h1 class="head">Ways to score runs</h1>
                The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs
                they
                must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). In doing this one run is scored.
                Cricket
                rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting
                boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. A four is scored by hitting the ball past
                the
                boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the
                full
                (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs
                physically ran
                by the batsman are null & void. They will only obtain the 4 or 6 runs.

                Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes & leg
                byes.
                Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the
                individual
                batters.
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7 f">A <h1 class="head">“No Ball”</h1> can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler
                bowls the ball from the wrong
                place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full),
                bounces
                more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions.
                The
                batsman can hit a no ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a no ball except if they are ran
                out, hit
                the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball
                for his
                shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself.</div>

            <div class="col-sm-7 f">A <h1 class="head">“Wide Ball”</h1> will be declared if the umpire thinks the
                batsman did not have a reasonable
                opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will
                not be
                declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the
                game
                while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and
                any runs
                scored by the batsman. The batsman is not able to get out off a wide delivery except if they are
                stumped, run
                out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field.</div>
            <div class="col-sm-7 f">
                A <h1 class="head">"Bye”</h1> is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman
                and runs
                are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.

            <div class="col-sm-7 f"> A <h1 class="head">“Leg Bye”</h1> is where runs are scored by hitting the batsman,
                but not the bat and the ball
                is not a no ball or wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn’t attempt to play a
                shot or
                if he was avoiding the ball.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Ways Batsmen can be given out according to cricket rules</h1>
                There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler
                gets a
                batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a “wicket”. Following are the different ways a batsman can
                be given
                out according to the rules of cricket:

            <div class="col-sm-7 f">
                <h1 class="head">1: Bowled</h1> Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking
                batsman’s
                wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not
                matter
                whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However
                the ball
                is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets.
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7 f">
                <h1 class="head">2: Caught </h1> Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball
                at all
                with his bat or hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the
                fielders,
                wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket
                rules
                state the batsman is out.

            <div class="col-sm-7 f">
                <h1 class="head">3: Leg Before Wicket (LBW)</h1> If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first
                without the
                bat hitting it then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first
                look at
                some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire need to decide is would the
                ball
                have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his answer to this is yes and the ball was not
                pitched on
                the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However if the ball hits the batsman
                outside the
                line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out.

                <h1 class="head">4: Stumped</h1> A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the
                wicketkeeper
                puts down his wicket while he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run
                it would

                grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the

                or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stried and the ball is in play then he is out. The
                striking
                batsman is also out if he hits his wicket down while setting off for his first run.
